How to
------

1. Install the AddOn as usual (e.g. "Elder Scrolls Online\live\AddOns\QuestMapCollector")

2. Start the game (or if you are already ingame, reload the UI with the chat command "/reloadui")

3. Use the command "/qmlog" to collect the data

4. Optional: You can remove the AddOn now

5. Quit the game or reload the UI again to write the file

6. Find the log file "Elder Scrolls Online\live\SavedVariables\QuestMapCollector.lua" (for EU use "liveeu" instead of "live")

7. Send me a PM with a link to the file (e.g. upload it to Dropbox, the file probably will be too long for a PM)
